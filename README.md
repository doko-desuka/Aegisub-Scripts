### Re-Shift All To Time

You type in a specific timestamp and then it shifts the times of all subtitles together as a group so the first subtitle will have that timestamp.
This is for when the subtitles are already synced but you have a different edit of the video with a different starting time, and you only need to match that start.  
(See also the built-in feature `Timing > Shift to Current Frame`, or `time/frame/current` for keybinds.)

### Auto Linebreaks

You type in a character-per-line (CPL) limit and then any text lines that are longer than that will have a linebreak inserted between the words where the limit is passed.
